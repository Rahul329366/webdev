    1. Perform the following exercise on the XAMPP server which will become an underlying structure for this assignment - 
        a. Create a database with the name Web having table the ‘users’.
        b. Users table should have the following columns - id (int, primary key, auto-increment), the username (varchar), email (varchar), gender (radio box), city (dropdown)
        c. All the fields are required
    2. Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user using a form and shows its addition on the same page. Make sure that you don’t get any error when submit button is clicked for empty inputs.

    3. Write a PHP script that takes data from the form and stores it in the ‘users’ table as described in question1.

    4. Write a PHP script that fetches data from the ‘users’ table and show it on a web page in a table format. Through this problem, you will learn to combine HTML, and PHP together.

    5. Write a PHP script that can update and delete a record that you fetched from the database and shown on a web page in the previous question. You should have a page for manipulating record which can take username as input and based on that it should show all the details related to that user in a row on the same page. In the same row, you should have a button to edit and delete the record. In case the user wants to update the record, he should be redirected to a new page showing previously-stored entries for the user in a form, having an update button. On submitting the form, the record should be updated and thereafter page should be redirected to the page showing all the records. In case of deletion, the user should be provided a confirmation message before deleting the record. If the user cancels the deletion, it should be redirected to the page showing all the records.

    6. Create two JavaScript variables firstName and lastName. Get these inputs from the browser and then print a message "Welcome firstName lastName to the World of Web ".
